# Security Tools for Information Security

## Overview
This repository contains projects completed as part of the **Security Tools for Information Security** course. The course was structured into two parts: **the Midterm CTF Challenge** and **the Final Tabletop Exercise**.

- **Midterm CTF Challenge:** A hands-on cybersecurity challenge involving **penetration testing techniques**, including **network scanning, web exploitation, and privilege escalation** to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Final Tabletop Exercise:** A **group-based incident response simulation**, analyzing a **ransomware attack scenario**, assessing risks, and formulating **strategic mitigation plans**.

## Repository Structure
- `midterm-ctf/` → Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, penetration testing methodology, and exploitation steps.
- `final-tabletop/` → Tabletop Exercise simulating a real-world cybersecurity incident response.
- `attack-methods/` → Documentation of attack techniques used in the CTF.

## Key Security Concepts Covered
- **Penetration Testing & Exploitation:** Network scanning, web vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation.
- **Incident Response & Risk Mitigation:** Handling cybersecurity threats in an organizational setting.
- **Brute-Force & Exploitation Techniques:** Use of tools like Hydra, SQLMap, and Nmap.
- **Cyber Threat Analysis & Security Planning:** Identifying attack vectors and response strategies.

## Project Details
- [Midterm CTF Challenge](midterm-ctf/README_Midterm.md)
- [Final Tabletop Exercise](final-tabletop/README_Final.md)

## Tools Used
- **Nmap** – Network scanning
- **Nikto** – Web vulnerability analysis
- **SQLMap** – SQL injection automation
- **Hydra** – Brute-force attack tool
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic analysis

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `midterm-ctf/` directory for penetration testing methodologies.
2. Explore `final-tabletop/` to review the incident response scenario.
3. Refer to `attack-methods/` for documentation on security techniques.
